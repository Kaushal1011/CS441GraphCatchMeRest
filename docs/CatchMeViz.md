This visualization tool enhances the understanding of game dynamics and strategies by providing a clear graphical representation of the game's progress.

## Features

- **Dynamic Graph Rendering**: Displays the game's graph with nodes and links, highlighting valuable nodes, police, and thief positions.
- **Interactive Gameplay Animation**: Step through the game's progression and watch the movement of police and thief on the graph.
- **Custom Node Identification**: Update node colors dynamically based on the roles of police and thief.
- **File Input for Log Data**: Load game log data directly from a file for visualization.
